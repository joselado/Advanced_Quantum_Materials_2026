# Advanced Quantum Materials 2026
Teaching material for the Advanced Quantum Materials course at Aalto University 2026

## Interactive exercise sessions
The folder sessions contains the Jupyter notebooks for the different sessions of the course
- [Session 1: Second quantization, mean field and spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://github.com/joselado/Advanced_Quantum_Materials_2026/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/session2.ipynb)
- [Session 2: Band structure theory](https://github.com/joselado/Advanced_Quantum_Materials_2026/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/session2.ipynb)
- [Session 3: Topological band structure theory](https://github.com/joselado/Advanced_Quantum_Materials_2026/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/session3.ipynb)
- [Session 4: The quantum Hall effect](https://github.com/joselado/Advanced_Quantum_Materials_2026/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/session4.ipynb)
- [Session 5: Superconductivity and Majorana physics](https://github.com/joselado/Advanced_Quantum_Materials_2026/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/session5.ipynb)

## Install
The Jupyter notebooks use [pyqula](https://github.com/joselado/pyqula), and can be installed from a terminal with pip as

```bash
pip install --upgrade pyqula
